Sample for multiple environments
================================

This sample demonstrates how to setup continuous integration and deployment of an Express+MongoDB
project with multiple Heroku environments. After the build is triggered by the webhook and the
project builds successfully, it is first deployed to the staging environment (separate Heroku app).

S
Then (likely after QA team performs acceptance tests), it can be manually pushed to the production
environment, which (again) is a separate Heroku application. This behavior is achieved by keeping
an extra branch (here called `production`) that points to the most recent build/commit approved 
(or 'promoted') for the production environment.

Shippable configuration
-----------------------

To be able to deploy to two Heroku applications, we need to add two separate remotes: `staging`, 
`production`. This is done here in `before_install` step:

    - git remote -v | grep ^staging || heroku git:remote --remote staging --app $STAGING_APP_NAME
    - git remote -v | grep ^production || heroku git:remote --remote production --app $PROD_APP_NAME

Then in `after_success` step, we can check on which branch we are currently and choose the correct
remote:

    - >
      [[ $BRANCH = 'production' ]] && REMOTE=production || REMOTE=staging
    - git push -f $REMOTE master

(note that we use `>`, so square brackets don't get interpreted by YAML parser)

Example workflow
----------------

This config can be then leveraged in a workflow like following. 

Assume that the developers work on `master` branch:

    git checkout master
    git add changes
    git commit -m "New shiny feature"
    git push

This commit will then trigger build on Shippable and get deployed to the Heroku app designated by
`STAGING_APP_NAME` environment variable. Now imagine this change gets accepted by QA team, but 
some other changes that arrived on `master` in the meantime are still to be tested:

    git add other_changes
    git commit -m "Another feature"
    git push

To manually deploy the shiny feature to the production, the developer would proceed as follows:

    git branch -f production 0de23d7 # hash of the commit that we want to deploy
    git push -f origin production

Now the build gets launched for `production` branch and the `shippable.yml` config above deploys
this specific commit to the production environment.
